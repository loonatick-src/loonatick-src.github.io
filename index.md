Welcome to my blog! It is a bit of a construction site at the moment
and will improve as I set things up. I will post about things that I
have worked on, things I find interesting, and perhaps some the
occasional ramble.

I am a computational scientist by training with a keen interest in
high performance computing (HPC) so most content might be of such
nature. Nevertheless, this blog is not intended to be too niche, hence
the name "Compute General".
